- 👋 Hi, I’m Bruno
- 👀 I’m interested in engineering projects, programming languages as C/C++, Rust, Julia and Java. Compiled languages and high performance computing, but I also like to learn what many programming languages have to offer. It is a big bonus to me if the project is an enginnering one.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the same programming languages I'm interested in, Verilog, VHDL. I also want to learn about optimizations, debugging and profiling techniques.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involves electrical engineering, softwares written in my languages of interest and techniques I want to learn and improve.
